# Particle Photon Client

Client app for the particle photon motor control application.

## Requirements

You will need to have the [dependencies for ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/installation.html) installed. The Ionic framework is a javascript based framework which allows rapid development of cross-platform web based interfaces.

## Getting started

Navigate to the local repository and run the following commands.

```
cd particle-photon-client
npm install
cd client
ionic serve
```

This will open your web-browser with the web version of the application. Then enter your particle photon credentials and you can view the settings for the device.

## Credits

This application was created by my friend, [Santhosh Kumar Balakrishnan](https://github.com/bsanth), for the purposes of the motor control project.
